# AI Instagram Tagger

This is a simple sinatra app that calls out to Rekognition, Cloud Vision and
Computer vision APIs from amazon, google and microsoft.

It also uses a list of top hash tags and hashtagify to suggest more tags for the
image.

My idea was that one day this would auto tag my instagram posts so I don't need
to think of tags but it's not there yet.
